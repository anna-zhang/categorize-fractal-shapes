# K-Means
This uses the k-means clustering algorithm to group images into categories based on similarity. The input directory where the images to cluster live can be changed in "input_dir" and the number of clusters can be changed in "k". The categories will be outputted in the folder "output", with subfolders for every cluster/category.

The code follows [Using K-Means Clustering for Image Segregation](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-k-means-clustering-for-image-segregation-fd80bea8412d) by Hrishi Patel.
