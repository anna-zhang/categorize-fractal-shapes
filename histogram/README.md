# Histogram Match
This uses histogram comparison to compute the difference between two images. The histograms of every image to categorize are computed. If the histogram comparison score, as computed using [cv2.compareHist(H1, H2, method)](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/dc7/group__imgproc__hist.html#gaf4190090efa5c47cb367cf97a9a519bd), is greater than a pre-defined match score, then the two images can be categorized together. In the cv2.compareHist() function, method can be any of the following: calculating the correlation between the two image histograms (cv2.HISTCMP_CORREL), finding the chi-square distance (cv2.HISTCMP_CHISQR), computing the intersection of two image histograms (cv2.HISTCMP_INTERSECT), or using Bhattacharyya distance (cv2.HISTCMP_BHATTACHARYYA). 

# Categorization
Images are first resized to a lower resolution. Images that do not meet a white pixel to total pixel ratio (white_threshold) are eliminated from later categorization consideration and placed in a "shapeless" category. Iterate through all of the remaining uncategorized images. The next image that has not been categorized is set as the “reference” image for a new shape category that is created. All remaining images that have not been categorized are compared with this reference image. If the two images have similar histograms–the match score is larger than histogram_cutoff–the uncategorized image is added to the reference image's shape category and classified as categorized.
