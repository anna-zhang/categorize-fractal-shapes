# Histogram Match
This uses histogram comparison to compute the difference between two images. The histograms of every image to categorize are computed. If the histogram comparison score, as computed using [cv2.compareHist(H1, H2, method)](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/dc7/group__imgproc__hist.html#gaf4190090efa5c47cb367cf97a9a519bd), is greater than a pre-defined match score, then the two images can be categorized together. In the cv2.compareHist() function, method can be any of the following: calculating the correlation between the two image histograms (cv2.HISTCMP_CORREL), finding the chi-square distance (cv2.HISTCMP_CHISQR), computing the intersection of two image histograms (cv2.HISTCMP_INTERSECT), or using Bhattacharyya distance (cv2.HISTCMP_BHATTACHARYYA).
